# hello-world

Hello,

I am an aspiring programmer located in Boone, NC.  I am proficient in Java, python and SQL.  I am interested in everything from data-science to app-development, and my focus is only limited by the hours in the day and what seems most pertinent to learn in the moment. 

Going forward, I am getting ready to begin mastering Spring Boot and uploading some fully fleshed-out projects next!
